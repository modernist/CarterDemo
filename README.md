# Carter Demo

A demo for Carter for my talk at IT Pro Dev Connections 2020.

Each commit contains the code needed to showcase a specific feature, so you can follow along with the presentation. A Postman collection is also provided to allow testing of all features.

You can find more detailed Carter samples at https://github.com/CarterCommunity/Carter
